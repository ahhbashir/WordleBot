# WordleBot
This is a bot I created using python that is able to efficiently complete the daily wordle.

## Installation
Make sure you have numpy installed, if you don't use the package manager pip to install numpy

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
To use the wordleBot first run the python program in the terminal

```terminal
python wordleBot.py
```

After running the program you will be given a suggested word to start with

Enter the word you choose to start with in Wordle as well as in the bot

Then input the result you get from wordle with
- g for a letter that is in the correct spot
- y for a letter that is in the word
- w for a letter that is not in the word

Repeat this process until you input 'ggggg' for your result
